This tiny blog has just been migrated from [octropress](http://octopress.org) to [hugo](http://gohugo.io).

Pros:  
1. service code and content (blog posts) are not mixed  
2. easy installation and configuration/customization process  
3. no more any troubles with ruby (on mac in particular)  
4. speed

Generator is written in go lang :-), maybe for someone this is an additional argument.

Cons:
... cant see, at least now

Good day!
