There is a nice python library [addict](https://github.com/mewwts/addict) which is interesting for a couple of reasons.

First of all, it simplifies creating a nested dictionary (see [readme](https://github.com/mewwts/addict/blob/master/README.md)).

Secondly, it represents an another nice example of using python magic methods.
