[Resilience4j](https://github.com/resilience4j/resilience4j) is a lightweight fault tolerance library which provides higher-order functions to enhance any functional interface, lambda expression or method reference with a Circuit Breaker, Rate Limiter, Retry or Bulkhead.   
Nice example of functional composition with pragmatic library with minimum number of dependencies.
