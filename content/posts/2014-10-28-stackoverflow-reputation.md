Some time ago i wrote [gist](https://gist.github.com/yantonov/10083524) which described how to install ghc from source on ubuntu. Today i see question on [stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com) connected with my gist. I have fixed gist immediately and think about leaving comment to person who had some difficulties with it. I log on using google account and try to leave comment and ... i cant do it because my repuration is too low (this is just new account). What ?!? This is service for questions and answers, why i have such strange limitation connected with main purpose of this resource. Completely disappointed.
