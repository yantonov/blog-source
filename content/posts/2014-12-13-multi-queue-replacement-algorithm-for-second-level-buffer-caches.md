I have read a nice [article](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/usenix01/full_papers/zhou/zhou.pdf "Multi-queue replacement algorithm for second level buffer caches") written by Yuanyian Zhou and James F. Philbin "Multi-queue replacement algorithm for second level buffer caches". Authors compares well known implementations LRU, MRU, LFU etc and introduces new, more efficient method based on multiple queues, which performs better than other described implementations.  
I highly recommend to read it.
