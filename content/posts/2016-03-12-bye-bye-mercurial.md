Has just migrated all my mercurial repositories to git. Its a little bit sad, but it will increase uniformity. More over there is [gitlab](https://gitlab.com "gitlab") which provides free private repositories as well as [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org "bitbucket").

P.s. [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yantonov/mercurial-tools/master/scripts/hg2git.sh "hg2git") is a simple script aimed to convert hg repo to git,  
maybe it will be helpful
