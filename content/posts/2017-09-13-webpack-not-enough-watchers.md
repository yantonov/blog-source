Not enough watchers
Verify that if you have enough available watchers in your system. If this value is too low, the file watcher in Webpack wonâ€™t recognize the changes:

```bash
cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches
```
Arch users, add fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 to /etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf and then execute sysctl --system. 

Ubuntu users (and possibly others): 

```bash
echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p
```
