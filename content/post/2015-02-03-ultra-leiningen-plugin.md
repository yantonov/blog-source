There is nice leiningen [plugin](http://blog.venanti.us/ultra/) named "Ultra" which can significantly improve your [clojure](http://clojure.org)'s repl interaction.

Main features:  
1. colorized output of data structures (using [solarized](https://github.com/altercation/solarized) theme)  
2. clear test output  
3. better stacktraces  
4. java object introspection.
